            <p class="description pmission">
                We are here to introduce a modern way of solving problems. Long ago, we used to raise our problems by writing our complain on paper with a pen using lot of papers. This website is the solution to save paper and also to make students' life easy.
            </p>
            <h2>WHO ARE WE?</h2> 
            <p class="description">
                We are a group of students at VIT Bhopal University, Madhya Pradesh.

                This is a one-stop website which is going to help solve almost all your problems and reach your voice and complain to the one who are sitting at higher positions.

                You will be able to raise your complain in an organised manner. You'll find a list of common areas of problems where students usually deal with. You can go over each section and raise your complain. This feature also helps the hostel management to keep the record of complaints in an organised manner.
